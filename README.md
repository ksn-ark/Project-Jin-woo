# Project S Levelling

name is a tad cringe but the goal is noble enough to negate it imo.
naturally, sl & opm inspired.

# Implementations

- mobile app, watch app and finally web app, all three should sync and integrate as seamlessly as possible

- watch app functionalities should have redundant substitutes on both mobile and web app, either through manual routines or otherwise

# Features

## Media Controls Wrapper

- media controls wrapper for the watch app (which WILL have a loop toggle adjust button, same on the notification bar for the mobile app), mainly support for spotify with some general support for mp3 players.

## Jog Route Mapping

- jog route mapping, gonna use google maps for this one, like distance caluclations, elevation calculations, time, saved routes, edit routes, share routes, whole shebang

## Articles Section

- general health tips, a little articles section from reliable sources, should be good

## Custom C-GPT

- have a little ai mentor that provides encouragement, but generally avoids any specific instructions or information so as to avoid misinformation/ai hallucinations.
- gonna make/use a custom gpt for this one

## Game System

#### Rank

- An abstract representation of physical wellness & fitness. Incremented through consistency and effort.

#### Goals

- Daily Goal - A fixed total goal of an exercise to be cleared within the day.
- Weekly Goal - A fixed total goal of activities to be cleared within the week.

#### Rewards

- Daily Reward - Fixed reward earnt by clearing a set amount of Daily Goal's within the day.
- Weekly Reward - Fixed reward earnt by clearing a set amount of Weekly Goal's within the week.

#### Levelling system

- Initial Level = 0
- Exp required to be level x = 0.9\*xÂ²
- User given standard progression would hit level 256 after a week in S-Rank

#### Stat system

- 1 Stat point is lost from each base stat every week from the second consecutive week of inactivity.
