weekly goal = steps taken, calories burnt, distance ran, daily goals met

daily stat rewards = +1 relevant stat point for each sub-goal (+1 stat point for number of tiers above E)
daily exp rewards = +100exp (+100 for number of tiers above E)
weekly stat rewards = +1 relevant stat point for each sub-goal + 1 x (daily goals met) stat point(s) + 1 x (weeks streak) stat point(s)
weekly exp rewards = +1000exp (+1000 for number of tiers above E)

E = 1 daily goals required to meet weekly goal
^ rank up after two consecutive weeks, 5 reps min
D = 2 daily goals required, 10 reps min
^ rank up after two consecutive weeks
C = 3 daily goals required, 15 reps min
^ rank up after three consecutive weeks
B = 4 daily goals required, 20 reps min
^ rank up after four consecutive weeks
A = 5 daily goals required, 25 reps min
^ rank up after five consecutive weeks
S = 6 daily goals required, 30 reps min

stat point drops are doubled if you hit double the min reps for the daily goals
except in S rank it is only doubled if you hit 100 reps

total exp required for a level = 0.9\*(level)^2

this way a user hits level 256 after a week in S tier after starting from E with nominal route in mind

some kind of negative feedback for losing streaks at around C

media controls wrapper for the watch app (which WILL have a loop toggle adjust button, same on the notification bar for the mobile app), mainly support for spotify with some general support for mp3 players.

jog route mapping, gonna use google maps for this one, like distance caluclations, elevation calculations, time, saved routes, edit routes, share routes, whole shebang

general health tips, a little articles section from reliable sources, should be good

mobile app, watch app and finally web app, all three should sync and integrate as seamlessly as possible
watch app functionalities should have redundant substitutes on both mobile and web app, either through manual routines or otherwise

have a little ai mentor that provides encouragement, but generally avoids any specific instructions or information so as to avoid misinformation/ai hallucinations
gonna make/use a custom gpt for this one
